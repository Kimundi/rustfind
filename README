attempt to use rust libsyntax to find symbol definitions
no where near ready yet..

"make" to compile and run test program

find_ast_node contains the node scanning
borrows code from rustdoc_ng

not sure what the best way is..

roadmap
[1] a commandline tool rustfind sourcefile.rs:LINE:COLUMN: --> definition.rs:LINE:col
(to add add hoc navigation tools eg gedit external tools)
  [.1] possibly an interactive commandline tool (enter symbol-> dump location)
  [.2] possibly queries like "list all the functions that use this type, list all the impls' for this type.."
[1.1] dump definition links in json or something .. incase this can be used s n indexer for existing tools
[2] options to dump/pretty print more context for the definitoon
[2.5] maybe one of those html hyperlinked source generators, like woboq?
[3] use components for IDE integration?
