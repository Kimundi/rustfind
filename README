attempt to use rust libsyntax to find symbol definitions
no where near ready yet..

"make" to compile and run test program

find_ast_node contains the node scanning
borrows code from rustdoc_ng

not sure what the best way is..

roadmap
[1] a commandline tool rustfind sourcefile.rs:LINE:COLUMN: --> definition.rs:LINE:col
(to add add hoc navigation tools eg gedit external tools)
[2] options to dump/pretty print more context for the definitoon
[3] components for IDE integration
